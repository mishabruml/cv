\end{itemize}

\textbf{Other skills and personal:}
Working in several environments with the public has taught me the importance of  people skills, and I consider myself a good communicator. Studying for my degree taught me how to organise my own workload, and multi-task, whilst working in a busy doctors surgery, pubs and kitchens through my youth has given me the ability to work effectively in a team. Working as an outdoor instructor, and as a sailing coach shows that I can also be a strong leader, and am responsible.\

During my free time I enjoy the outdoors, especially mountaineering and rock climbing. I have been a member of the University Mountaineering Club while at Leeds and also in Glasgow. It is my passion for rock climbing that led me to seek work in the mountains of Spain (El Chorro, Andalusia) for 8 months over the winter 2016/2017.
